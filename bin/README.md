# Project 5: Snake Game

## Overview
This project displays a Graphical User Interface(GUI) 
for the classic computer game "Snake".

## Reflection
This project was quite frustrating at times. I have had no prior experience with GUI's before this project, so there was a lot I had to learn on my own to complete even the basics. I don't feel like I created the best program possible, but I am proud of what I could make with the time and resources I was given. I think I learned the most out of any project, since I was constantly looking in the Java API for instructions on how certain elements of the project worked.
I had a lot of trouble with the key listener. I watched many, many youtube videos to figure it out, yet it seemed like nothing was working. It took lots of trial and error until I found something that worked correctly. If possible, in the grading of this project(and the correction I receive), could you tell me how well the code is written? It was a totally foreign concept to learn, so I'm not 100% sure I implemented it correctly. There were other obstacles along the way, but I think the finished product is pretty good.

(I was having trouble with the display when I resized the board in the settings panel. Is that just something with my display, or a software fix?)

## Compiling and Using
To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac SnakeGUI.java
```
Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java SnakeGUI
```
Almost immediately, the snake will begin "slithering" from left to right.
Use arrow keys to guide the snake around the screen. The game is over if the snake runs into itself or the surrounding edges. Try to get the high score!
